This project intends to follow along the following paper:

Rivero, D., Fernandez-Blanco, E., & Pazos, A. (2022). DoME: A deterministic technique for equation development and Symbolic Regression. Expert Systems with Applications, 198, 116712. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116712


In it, an algorithm is proposed for building a symbolic expression from a set of observations (Symbolic Regression).
